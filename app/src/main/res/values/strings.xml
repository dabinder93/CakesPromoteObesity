        <big>To start the game, each player draws ten White Cards.</big> \n
        <big>One random Player begins as the so called</big> <b>„Card Czar“</b><big>.</big>
        \n \n
        <big>A Black Card will be revealed to all Players. \n
        Everyone (except the Czar) answers the question or fills in the blank written on that black card, by selecting one white Card from their hand.</big>
        \n
        <big>After everyone selected a Card, or when the Countdown went to 0, those cards are presented to the Card Czar.</big>
        \n \n
        <big>Now the Czar has 60 seconds to pick the funniest play, and whoever submitted it gets one Awesome Point.</big> \n
        <big>If no one selected a card, the Czar gets a Point.</big> \n
        <big>If the Czar didn’t pick a card, he loses one Point.</big>
        \n \n
        <big>After the round, a new player becomes the Card Czar, and everyone else draws back up to ten White Cards.</big>

        <b>Whoever reaches the defined Win Points, wins the Game!</b>
